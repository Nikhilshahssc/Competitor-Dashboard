        <h3>Why We Win</h3>
        <table>
            <tr><th>Theme</th><th>SS&C Advantage</th><th>Apex Limitation</th></tr>
            <tr><td>Global Scale</td><td>SS&C is the largest fund administrator globally with $45T+ AUA and 27,000+ employees.</td><td>Apex ranks #5 with $3.5T AUA, built via 30+ acquisitions.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Technology Ownership</td><td>SS&C owns platforms like Geneva, Advent, Eze, GoCentral</td><td>Apex uses a system-agnostic model, relying on third-party tech, including SS&C-owned platforms.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Institutional Trust</td><td>SS&C serves Tier 1 PE, HF, and real asset managers.</td><td>Apex is more prominent in the mid-market.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Operational Resilience</td><td>SS&C’s scale + AI automation = predictable delivery and reduced risk.</td><td>Apex’s M&A-heavy model = fragmentation, integration risk, and client complaints.</td></tr>
        </table>

        <h3>Win Themes (Use in Every Pitch)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>“We’re built for scale — Apex is built for speed.” → SS&C’s infrastructure supports billion-dollar mandates. Apex’s agility comes at the cost of consistency.</li>
            <li>“We own the tech — they rent it.” → SS&C’s proprietary platforms mean faster innovation and tighter security. Apex relies on third-party systems, including ours.</li>
            <li>“We’re the institutional-grade choice.” → SS&C is trusted by Tier 1 managers. Apex is better known in the mid-market.</li>
            <li>“We don’t just onboard — we integrate.” → SS&C’s onboarding is process-driven and scalable. Apex’s onboarding varies by acquisition.</li>
            <li>“We’re stable — they’re still stitching.” → SS&C’s growth is predictable and organic. Apex is still integrating 30+ acquisitions.</li>
            <li>“We’re the long-term partner — not the short-term fix.” → SS&C’s clients stay for decades. Apex’s churn and turnover raise continuity concerns.</li>
            <li>“We scale with your ambition — not against it.” → SS&C supports clients from launch to multi-billion AUM. Apex’s model struggles with large, complex mandates.</li>
            <li>“We’re built for complexity — not just coverage.” → SS&C handles complex fund structures, cross-border operations, and regulatory nuances. Apex’s patchwork model can’t match that depth.</li>
            <li>“We don’t just grow — we grow with control.” → SS&C’s growth is strategic and stable. Apex’s rapid M&A growth introduces risk and inconsistency.</li>
            <li>“We’re future-proof — Apex is still catching up.” → SS&C’s proprietary platforms evolve with client needs. Apex must wait on third-party vendors or acquisitions to adapt.</li>
            <li>“We scale globally — not just regionally.” → SS&C has a unified global operating model. Apex’s global presence is fragmented by acquired entities.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Apex Weaknesses to Exploit</h3>
        <table>
            <tr><th>Apex Weakness</th><th>SS&C Counter-Positioning</th><th>Objection Handling</th></tr>
            <tr><td>Operational Fragmentation</td><td>SS&C has a mature, stable structure.</td><td>Apex’s internal issues and client complaints are acknowledged by leadership. SS&C offers consistency.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Technology Integration Issues</td><td>SS&C’s platforms are award-winning and purpose-built.</td><td>Apex’s Microsoft case study shows UX and performance issues post-acquisition. SS&C avoids this via ownership.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Regulatory Bottlenecks</td><td>SS&C’s financial strength enables smoother M&A execution.</td><td>Apex’s deals (Sanne, Mainstream) faced delays. SS&C navigates these efficiently.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Limited PE/VC Depth</td><td>SS&C is the largest PE administrator with platforms like eFront.</td><td>Apex offers broad coverage but lacks deep specialization in private markets.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Fund Admin Dependency</td><td>SS&C has diversified revenue streams across industries.</td><td>Apex is heavily reliant on fund admin, limiting innovation.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Over-Reliance on Tech</td><td>SS&C offers customizable, all-in-one platforms with 200+ APIs.</td><td>Apex’s hybrid model leads to rigidity and integration friction.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Mixed Testimonials</td><td>SS&C has verified case studies and endorsements.</td><td>Apex lacks consistent, public testimonials for core services.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Third-Party Tech Dependency</td><td>SS&C owns its tech stack.</td><td>Apex depends on platforms owned by SS&C, creating strategic risk.</td></tr>

<h3>SS&C Differentiators to Push</h3>
<table>
<tr><th>Category</th><th>SS&C Advantage</th><th>Apex Limitation</th></tr>
<tr><td>Technology</td><td>Proprietary platforms (Calastone, Geneva, Advent, Eze)</td><td>Patchwork, non-integrated acquired systems</td></tr>
<tr><td>Global Reach</td><td>Deep network in 50+ markets with transfer agency scale</td><td>Expanding but limited to acquired footprints</td></tr>
<tr><td>Private Markets</td><td>Proven track record with Tier 1 PE & HF managers</td><td>Stronger in mid-market, limited mega-fund wins</td></tr>
<tr><td>Stability</td><td>Strong balance sheet, predictable growth</td><td>Debt-fueled acquisitions, integration risk</td></tr>
<tr><td>Client Experience</td><td>Institutional-grade processes, scalable onboarding</td><td>Relationship-based, less process-driven</td></tr>
</table>

<h3>Talking Points for Client Conversations</h3>
<table>
<tr><th>Client Concern</th><th>SS&C Response</th></tr>
<tr><td>“How do you ensure service consistency across regions?”</td><td>SS&C has unified processes and proprietary tech across 50+ markets. Apex’s service varies by region due to ongoing M&A integration.</td></tr>
<tr><td>“What happens if we scale quickly?”</td><td>SS&C supports mega-funds and complex structures with scalable infrastructure. Apex’s fragmented systems and staffing limit scalability.</td></tr>
<tr><td>“We’re considering Apex for their ESG offering.”</td><td>SS&C embeds ESG into its core platforms using AI — no need for a separate brand or bolt-on service.</td></tr>
<tr><td>“Apex seems more flexible for our size.”</td><td>SS&C supports mid-market clients too — but with institutional-grade infrastructure that scales with you.</td></tr>
<tr><td>“We’ve heard Apex is more responsive.”</td><td>SS&C has dedicated client delivery teams and onboarding specialists. Apex’s responsiveness varies by acquisition and region.</td></tr>
<tr><td>“We’re already using Apex’s tech stack.”</td><td>Much of Apex’s stack includes SS&C-owned platforms like Geneva and eFront. Why not work directly with the source?</td></tr>
<tr><td>“Apex says they’re more agile.”</td><td>Agility without structure leads to risk. SS&C offers agility at scale, with proven delivery frameworks.</td></tr>
<tr><td>“We’re already using Apex’s ESG services.”</td><td>SS&C integrates ESG into core workflows using AI and automation — no need for a separate brand or bolt-on.</td></tr>
<tr><td>“We like Apex’s pricing.”</td><td>SS&C’s automation and platform ownership reduce total cost of ownership over time. Apex’s hidden costs emerge during integration.</td></tr>
<tr><td>“We’ve had a good experience with Apex so far.”</td><td>That’s great — but as you scale, consistency, control, and global reach become critical. SS&C is built for that next stage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>“Apex is already in our RFP.”</td><td>Understood — but ask them how much of their stack they actually own. Then compare that to SS&C’s fully integrated ecosystem.</td></tr>
<tr><td>“We’re a mid-market manager — Apex fits us.”</td><td>SS&C supports mid-market clients too — but with the added benefit of scale, stability, and future-proof tech.</td></tr>
</table>

<h3>Red Flags to Watch For</h3>
<table>
<tr><th>Apex Claim</th><th>SS&C Reframe</th></tr>
<tr><td>“Boutique, flexible”</td><td>SS&C = scale + stability + tech-enabled flexibility</td></tr>
<tr><td>“Aggressive pricing”</td><td>SS&C’s automation → lower total cost of ownership</td></tr>
<tr><td>“Fast onboarding”</td><td>SS&C = proven scale without service disruption</td></tr>
<tr><td>“We’re nimble and flexible.”</td><td>SS&C = flexibility at scale, with institutional-grade delivery.</td></tr>
<tr><td>“We’re cheaper.”</td><td>SS&C’s automation and integration reduce long-term costs. Apex’s patchwork model increases hidden costs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>“We’re fintech-enabled.”</td><td>Apex’s tech stack includes legacy systems from acquisitions. SS&C’s platforms are purpose-built and award-winning.</td></tr>
<tr><td>“We’re system-agnostic.”</td><td>That means they rely on third-party tech, including SS&C’s own platforms — creating dependency and integration risk.</td></tr>
<tr><td>“We integrate best-in-class tools.”</td><td>Integration ≠ ownership. SS&C’s platforms are natively integrated, reducing friction and improving performance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>“We’re flexible with tech.”</td><td>Flexibility without control leads to inconsistency, delays, and security risks. SS&C owns the roadmap.</td></tr>
<tr><td>“We’re fast to onboard.”</td><td>SS&C = proven onboarding frameworks. Apex = variable onboarding depending on acquisition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>“We’re ESG-first.”</td><td>SS&C integrates ESG into core platforms using AI — no need for a separate brand.</td></tr>
<tr><td>“We’re innovative.”</td><td>SS&C owns its tech and invests in R&D. Apex uses third-party platforms, including SS&C’s.</td></tr>
<tr><td>“We’re global.”</td><td>SS&C has a deeper, organically built global footprint. Apex’s reach is acquisition-dependent.</td></tr>

  <h3>Why We Win</h3>

    <tr>
      <td>Global Scale</td>
      <td>SS&C operates across 50+ markets, with global delivery centers and 27,000+ employees.</td>

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Technology Ownership</td>
      <td>SS&C builds and owns its platforms (e.g., Geneva, Advent, GoCentral) — enabling true integration.</td>

      <td>Institutional-Grade Infrastructure</td>
      <td>SS&C supports mega-funds and global managers with institutional onboarding, controls, and automation.</td>

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Integrated Platform</td>
      <td>SS&C offers a single-source-of-truth platform across fund, investor, and corporate data.</td>
      <td>Aztec’s reliance on disparate third-party tools requires manual processes and data reconciliation.</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <h3>Win Themes (Use in Every Pitch)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>“We own the tech — they configure it.” → SS&C delivers faster innovation, better security, and seamless integration. Aztec builds around vendor tools.</li>
    <li>“We scale with your ambition — they scale with your current size.” → SS&C serves clients from startup to $100B+. Aztec is better for static mid-market needs.</li>
    <li>“We’re institutional-grade — not just relationship-led.” → SS&C’s infrastructure reduces key-person risk. Aztec’s service is highly dependent on relationship leads.</li>
    <li>“We’re automated — not manual.” → SS&C automates complex workflows. Aztec’s tailored approach creates manual friction.</li>
    <li>“We’re unified — they’re fragmented.” → SS&C’s platforms are purpose-built to work together. Aztec pieces together third-party tools.</li>

    <summary>🥇 SS&C Sales Battlecard: Winning vs SEI</summary>

    <h3>Why We Win</h3>
    <table>
      <tr><th>Theme</th><th>SS&C Advantage</th><th>SEI Limitation</th></tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Institutional Control</td>
        <td>SS&C owns its entire alternatives tech stack (e.g., Geneva), ensuring end-to-end control and no counterparty risk.</td>
        <td>SEI's $1.5T private credit platform runs on SS&C’s Advent Geneva — exposing them to a competitor's control.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Flexibility & Customization</td>
        <td>SS&C delivers bespoke solutions across complex asset classes with full flexibility.</td>

      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Integrated Technology</td>
        <td>SS&C’s tax-aware and UMH features are native, built directly into the platform.</td>

      </tr>
    </table>

    <h3>Win Themes (Use in Every Pitch)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>“We own the code — they license it.” → SEI’s core private credit engine runs on SS&C’s Geneva. That’s not control. That’s dependency.</li>
      <li>“We scale complexity — they standardize it.” → SEI’s model works for the masses, not for bespoke clients. We adapt. They divest.</li>
      <li>“We integrate from the core — they bolt on from the side.” → SS&C’s UMH capabilities are native. SEI’s are newly acquired and risk-laden.</li>
      <li>“We modernize — they maintain legacy.” → SS&C is cloud-native and modern. SEI still runs TRUST 3000® for key processes.</li>
      <li>“We control the stack — they’re at our mercy.” → SEI’s reliance on SS&C systems gives us leverage. Not them.</li>
    </ul>

        <td>SS&C owns Advent Geneva, which SEI uses for $1.5T in alternatives.</td>

        <td>Rigid BPO Model (SWP)</td>
        <td>SS&C delivers flexible, tailored solutions.</td>

        <td>“SEI is now a dominant leader with $1.5T in Alternative AUA.”</td>
        <td>“Ask who owns the system that powers their core. SEI depends on SS&C’s Geneva — that’s not control. That’s exposure to a competitor.”</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>“The SEI Wealth Platform is a unified, risk-reducing solution.”</td>
        <td>“It’s unified — but rigid. If your structure doesn’t fit their mold, they’ll ask you to leave. Just ask Archway.”</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>“The LifeYield acquisition gives SEI cutting-edge tax capabilities.”</td>
        <td>“Ours were built into the platform from day one — not bolted on later with API complexity and integration risk.”</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>“SEI’s 55-year history ensures stability.”</td>
        <td>“Legacy means baggage. TRUST 3000® still runs core functions. That’s not future-ready — that’s technical debt.”</td>

      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>“We secure distribution with strategic partnerships (e.g., Stratos).”</td>
        <td>Captive distribution ≠ client value. Advisors adopt because they must, not because the platform wins on merit.</td>

        <td><strong>Objection:</strong> "Gen II has the most experienced team in the industry."<br>
            <strong>Response:</strong> "Expertise is essential, but it must be resilient. Their high-touch model relies heavily on specific, long-tenured individuals, creating single points of failure. Our global scale and unified platform mean service continuity is guaranteed by institutional strength, not individual reliance."</td>
      </tr>

        <td><strong>Objection:</strong> "Sensr is our proprietary, cutting-edge solution."<br>
            <strong>Response:</strong> "Sensr offers a great interface, but what powers the core? If core accounting runs on Investran or Yardi, bespoke reporting requires continuous data transfer. Our platform is a true single source of truth, eliminating the data lag and manual reconciliation risk their layered architecture demands."</td>

            <strong>Response:</strong> "Acquisition provides presence, but integration provides stability. The rapid merger of complex, regulated EU systems and processes (like Depositary) introduces acute risk. Our organic build and proven integration track record ensure regulatory consistency from day one."</td>

      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Proprietary Investor-Facing Technology (Sensr)</td>
        <td>Position SS&C's integrated platform as natively superior because the portal and the general ledger share the exact same data source, ensuring real-time integrity and speed for all reporting, not just the front-end view.</td>
        <td>Clients praise the Sensr suite for being "intuitive, powerful, and built with the investor experience in mind." The counter is to expose the reliance on Investran and Yardi for core data.</td>

      <tr>
        <td>Institutional Ownership Mandate (General Atlantic/Hg)</td>

        <td>"Gen II achieved $1 Trillion AUA through necessary, but risky, acquisition (Crestbridge), not unified, organic platform growth. True service expertise is not measured by sheer size, but by consistent, single-platform delivery across all global offices. Scale without seamless integration introduces friction."</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>"Gen II's proprietary Sensr technology is exactly the innovation our investors demand."</td>

We offer a true single-source data platform, eliminating the manual reconciliation and data lag inherent in their layered architecture."</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>"Gen II offers a dedicated team structure and deep PE focus, assuring expertise."</td>
        <td>"While deep expertise is valuable, their exclusive focus limits your optionality. As you pursue complex hybrid or liquid strategies, you will outgrow them. Our multi-asset platform offers superior flexibility and future-proofing, ensuring you never have to migrate when your strategy evolves."</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>"Gen II has strong institutional ownership (General Atlantic/Hg) which signals quality."</td>
        <td>"Institutional ownership means an exit is inevitable. That focus on exponential growth often replaces high-touch intimacy with cost optimization. This model prioritizes AUA growth over consistent relationship management, increasing the risk of service dilution for mid-market clients."</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>"Gen II expanded into Europe, so they can handle my global requirements."</td>
        <td>"They acquired a European platform (Crestbridge) to gain entry, which is a major integration project. Integrating highly regulated services like Depositary and ManCo across multiple EU regimes rapidly creates service continuity risk and potential regulatory gaps. We offer proven, stable global service delivery."</td>

        <td>"Our technology is proprietary and customized for private markets."</td>
        <td>"The proprietary solutions (Sensr) are layered on top of off-the-shelf core accounting systems (Investran, Yardi). This structural duality creates a risk of data inconsistencies, lag, and complex, manual reconciliation, especially during high-demand reporting cycles."</td>

      <tr>
        <td>"We offer a single, cohesive team with service continuity."</td>
        <td>"Their rapid M&amp;A growth and aggressive integration mandates create acute talent retention risk, especially within the newly acquired European teams. Loss of key specialized personnel compromises the 'longest-tenured team' promise and introduces service volatility."</td>

      <tr>
        <td>"We have deep expertise across real assets, credit, and infrastructure."</td>

        <td>"Their corporate services, including regulatory expertise in Europe (Depositary/ManCo), are newly acquired via Crestbridge.

    <tr><td>We're built for scale</td><td>SS&amp;C's infrastructure supports billion-dollar mandates.</td><td>Citco's agility comes at the cost of consistency.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Technology</td><td>SS&amp;C's proprietary technology is built on a single, unified stack, eliminating data silos and integration friction.</td><td>Citco's technology is a patchwork of proprietary and third-party systems, leading to operational complexity.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Pricing &amp; Value</td><td>SS&amp;C provides competitive and transparent pricing across all services, including ancillary offerings like tax and financial statements.</td><td>Citco targets large mandates, has rigid fees, and uses inconsistent pricing, often making ancillary services more expensive.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Service &amp; Operations</td><td>Global “follow the sun” model ensures consistent, proactive service. Strong client and employee satisfaction scores.</td><td>Citco’s poor satisfaction scores and internal dynamics lead to inconsistent pitches and poor coordination.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Forward-Looking</td><td>SS&amp;C has a clear strategy and investment in ESG, AI, and custom builds.</td><td>Citco lacks a visible strategy for AI and ESG, and avoids custom builds in favor of standardized offerings.</td></tr>

<tr><td>Historical Legal Failures</td><td>Publicly-traded with robust governance.</td><td>We don’t comment on private firms’ legal history, but our transparency and governance provide peace of mind.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Limited Custody Services</td><td>Integrated platform with strong custodian relationships and consolidated reporting.</td><td>Fragmented custody models create risk. Our unified view eliminates that friction.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Poor Client &amp; Employee Satisfaction</td><td>Client- and employee-centric model with high NPS and CSAT scores.</td><td>Sentiment is a leading indicator. Our scores reflect our commitment to long-term partnerships.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Inconsistent &amp; Rigid Pricing</td><td>Transparent, competitive, and predictable pricing.</td><td>Inconsistent pricing often signals poor coordination. We offer a streamlined, reliable quoting process.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Technology Fragmentation</td><td>Single-stack, end-to-end platform built for complex tasks.</td><td>Third-party reliance (e.g., Investran, Yardi) creates silos. Our unified platform ensures seamless operations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Valuation Limitations</td><td>Market leader in complex valuations and OTC pricing.</td><td>Poor pricing strategy limits adoption. We deliver value that drives usage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Lack of ESG/AI Strategy</td><td>Documented, proactive ESG and AI strategy.</td><td>Gaps in ESG/AI suggest a reactive mindset. We empower sales with clear solutions and policies.</td></tr>

<tr><td>ESG</td><td>Publicly-documented ESG program with tools for monitoring, reporting, and compliance.</td><td>No formal ESG documentation or narrative.</td></tr>
<tr><td>CMP</td><td>Formal Client Management Platform (CMP) centralizes all client data.</td><td>No formal CMP; client outreach based on profitability.</td></tr>

<h3>Talking Points for Client Conversations</h3>
<table>
<tr><th>Client Concern</th><th>SS&amp;C Response</th></tr>
<tr><td>Why move from a loyal provider like Citco?</td><td>Loyalty reflects past success, not future performance. Citco’s low satisfaction scores contrast with our high NPS and CSAT.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Citco is a pioneer in the industry.</td><td>We respect their legacy, but we lead in the present and future with integrated tech and proactive innovation in AI and ESG.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Citco’s fund accounting pricing seems competitive.</td><td>Citco may discount core services but overcharge for ancillary ones. We offer transparent, all-in pricing with better overall value.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Their biometric onboarding app sounds innovative.</td><td>Innovation is great, but onboarding must be robust. Our single-system approach ensures a smoother, more complete onboarding experience.</td></tr>
<tr><td>They claim to be the largest fund administrator.</td><td>SS&amp;C is ranked #1 in private equity and debt administration and leads by assets and fund count. We have the scale and tech to support any mandate.</td></tr>

    <h3>Win Themes (Use in Every Pitch)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>“We scale intelligently — HedgeServ builds carefully.” → SS&C delivers speed, control, and scale through strategic acquisitions.</li>
      <li>“We integrate — they require you to conform.” → SS&C adapts to your existing tech stack; HedgeServ’s model often requires clients to fit theirs.</li>
      <li>“We future-proof with flexibility.” → Modular architecture allows SS&C to evolve rapidly, whereas HedgeServ depends on internal development cycles.</li>
      <li>“We offer institutional-grade at scale.” → SS&C provides robust services to both mid-market and global asset managers.</li>
      <li>“We remove friction — they build silos.” → Our platforms are built for integration, while their proprietary tech can limit optionality.</li>
      <li>“We support your entire lifecycle — not just hedge.” → SS&C covers all asset classes across jurisdictions, beyond hedge-only expertise.</li>
